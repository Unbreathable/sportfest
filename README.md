## Sportfest
**Sportfest is still work in progress.** Here is a list of things it will hopefully be able to do when it is fully stable:

Sportfest is a simple app to put together teams for games in a sports event based on interests people enter through a simple web frontend. It is only capable of dividing a large group of people into two dedicated teams for all the games specified in the admin panel.

The two teams are choosen based on:
- One friend that can be entered by every player (both have to enter the same name)
- Games that were chosen by the player

The algorithm tries to give every player as much of their wanted games as possible and makes sure everyone gets what they want. It is not perfect though and **manual labour is still required** to get the games into a perfect shape. Things such as time management or making sure both teams are of the same size per match will have to be handled through the admin panel although there is another algorithm integrated into the admin panel that can make suggestions based on player interests to fill teams easier. It will also mark which players have added each other as friends and warns if they are splitted.
